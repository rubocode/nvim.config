# nvim.config

This is my current neovim configuration.  The _Lazy_ package manager has
allowed great simplification of managing your personal development environment
(PDE).

I don't code in a hundred thousand languages.  I was a _c/c++_ programmer
with a touch of _perl_ in my younger years and now I explore newer static
compiled languages such as _go_.  On the dynamic side I have preferred _ruby_
over _python_ and have now added _lua_ which is useful in customizing the PDE.

This config is meant to be robust and resilient and to allow for flexible
adjustment.  It was not meant to load faster, although it does that too.

Things don't have to get more complicated than they need to be.
Personal discretion is of the essence.

When was speed a virtue?  If you can't figure that one out by yourself,
ask your girlfriend or wife.

User experience is the key! ;)
