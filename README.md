# nvim.config

This is my current neovim configuration.
The _Lazy_ package manager has allowed great simplification of managing your
development environment.

I don't code in a hundred thousand languages.  I was a C/C++ programmer in
my younger years and now I explore newer static compiled languages such as
_go_ and _rust_.

On the dynamic side I have preferred _ruby_ over _python_ and have now added
_lua_ which is useful in customizing the Personal Development Environment (PDE).

This config is meant to be robust and resilient and to allow for flexible
adjuustment.  It was not meant to load faster, although it does that too.

When was speed a virtue?  If you can't figure that one out by yourself,
ask your girlfriend or wife.
